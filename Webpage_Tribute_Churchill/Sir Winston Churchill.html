<h3> Synopsis: </h3>
    <p>
      Born to an aristocratic family in 1874, Winston Churchill served in the British military and worked as a writer before going into politics. <br> After becoming prime minister in 1940, he helped lead a successful Allied strategy with the U.S. and Soviet Union during WWII to defeat <br> the Axis powers and craft post-war peace. Elected prime minister again in 1951, he introduced key domestic reforms. <br> Churchill died at age 90 in 1965.
